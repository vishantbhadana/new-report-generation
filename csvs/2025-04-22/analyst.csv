ALKEM,"Alkem Laboratories has demonstrated strong growth potential, supported by its robust domestic business, which contributes ~70% of total revenue and consistently outperforms the Indian Pharmaceutical Market across key therapies such as gastrointestinal, anti-diabetic, and neuro/CNS. The chronic portfolio, including high-growth brands like Dapanorm and Glucoryl, is scaling rapidly, with aspirations to increase its revenue share from 17% to 20%. The Trade Generics segment, where Alkem is the market leader, is expected to deliver double-digit growth, backed by a dedicated field force and extensive stockist coverage.

Its trailing P/E of 26.8 and PEG ratio of 1.52 suggest moderate valuation relative to its growth trajectory, while a dividend yield of 0.80% offers modest income for investors.

The company’s financial metrics further underscore its strength, with an operating profit margin of 24.5%, net profit margin of 18.5%, and EPS growth of 33.56% YoY, highlighting robust profitability and shareholder returns. Alkem’s RoE of 18.1% and RoIC of 25% reflect efficient capital utilization, while its net cash position of Rs.47 billion enables sustained investments in R&D and operational scaling. The company’s strategic focus on chronic therapies, biosimilars, and Trade Generics aligns with emerging healthcare trends, ensuring long-term value creation. While challenges such as price erosion in the US generics market persist, Alkem’s diversification efforts and innovative product pipeline position it well for sustained growth. Overall, Alkem Laboratories is poised to capitalize on its leadership in domestic markets and expand its global footprint, making it an attractive investment opportunity in the short to mid-term."
SHYAMMETL,"Shyam Metalics and Energy Limited presents a compelling investment opportunity in the short to mid-term, driven by its robust operational performance and strategic initiatives. The company has demonstrated resilience with a 10.19% QoQ PAT growth and an impressive 48.75% PAT growth QYoY, despite a 4.31% QoQ decline in sales.
